    is the argument 'sets' referring to one {set_id :set} instance or does refer to a dictionary that contains multiple instances of {set_id : set}?

    If it contains one instance of {set_id : set} only, it would be easy to just partition the values in that instance into nparts and return the nparts as dictionaries
    However, if there were multiple {set_id : set} instances, how does one partition them without accounting for if those different instances of {set_id : set} were unrelated?
    Is it possible to jumble all all the dictionary values of the different instances into one big set and then partition from there? 

    On return, what keys will the partitioned dictionaries be described with?
